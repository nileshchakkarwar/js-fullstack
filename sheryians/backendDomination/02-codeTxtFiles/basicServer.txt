- JS is a single threaded webserver
- By doing using **http.createServer()** we are formally defining the thread that will always be ready to accept any requests directed towards it

- req ➡️ node ➡️ rsp
    - req and rsp are terminologies that are always in context of server.
    - requesting a server
    - response from a server
